# Generating a Wrestling Storyline with AI

### Introduction
Since its foundation, professional wrestling has prioritized storytelling and entertainment, which contrasts with professional combat sports. With the rising popularity of storytelling initiatives in the early 80s, pro wrestling companies thrived on the unconventional narrative of telling stories within a ring. This was a departure from live stage drama, incorporating hard-hitting moves, high-impact drama, and generational talent.

The pioneer of modern wrestling's mass success is often attributed to WWE's early WrestleMania events, with WrestleMania 3, in particular, cementing the event as "The Showcase of the Immortals." Since then, competitors have used their own methods of narrating elaborate storylines and high-octane pay-per-views (PPVs) to rival WWE's success, implementing their own creative control—for better or worse. The wrestling industry has subsequently seen the rise and fall of various companies, all striving to satisfy consumer demand.

Therefore, it's apparent that a core component of any wrestling promotion's success, beyond the matches themselves, is the storyline. Storylines define who rises to the top of the promotion and the industry, with outcomes being entirely dependent on creative control.

Based on this, I decided to create my own pro wrestling storyline with the assistance of AI. The goal was to see if characters, developed through AI, could be manifested into a realistic wrestling scenario. Here is my approach, methodology, and the key findings from this experiment.

### Approaching the Idea
My approach to this idea was relatively straightforward, as pro wrestling is already a mainstream medium appreciated by consumers worldwide. The narratives and matches can vary from grounded realism to absurd situations, primarily to appeal to a wide range of viewer preferences.

My idea started with creating a persona. It took a few iterative prompts to develop a unique gimmick for my fictional wrestler.

Second, I needed to implement this persona into a storyline. This was also a tricky part, but the solution lay in adapting a storyline that had already occurred. A major point of debate among fans worldwide is the "what if" scenario, exploring how a different outcome in a key storyline or incident could have changed everything. For example: "What if Brock Lesnar didn’t break The Undertaker's streak?" or "What if Kurt Angle had pursued a different career?" Fans often create elaborate butterfly effect theories to explore these "what if" ideas.

The solution was to adopt a similar "what if" concept and build a new storyline around it. For this project, I used the famous Sting vs. nWo feud from late-90s WCW. My premise was: What if the climatic match between Hulk Hogan and Sting at Starrcade 1997 wasn't botched?

After overcoming these two hurdles, I used an AI to generate the content. Here are my key findings.

### Key Findings

**Success:**
While my primary idea was to explore Sting not losing to the nWo, I adjusted my prompts to build a larger narrative leading up to that specific ending. The AI generated a new storyline that blended old-school and modern pro wrestling tropes. Although the output had a generic storytelling fashion, its absurdity was a quirk that resonates with many indie and Japanese pro wrestling promotions. In the end, I was quite satisfied with the AI's result, as it produced a unique storyline and implemented the elements I requested.

**Challenges:**
My initial goal was to build a narrative consistent with the norms of that era. However, the AI's inconsistency in treating the plot more like general fiction rather than a specific wrestling narrative was unsatisfactory. This was likely due to a lack of precise interpretation or sufficient prompt iterations on my end. Providing insufficient context to the AI before asking it to generate an output was another reason that made content generation more challenging.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, this experiment proved that with refinement and added context, an AI can generate output that satisfies user needs. However, it takes a significant trial-and-error process to unlock the full potential of AI content generation.
